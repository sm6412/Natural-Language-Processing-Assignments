HW 4

Tokenization:
In order to tokenize the words in the queries and abstracts, I removed the punctuation and numbers and rebuilt the strings. The only punctuation I left in was the presence of a dashes because they are sometimes needed in order to form a word like “forward-facing” for instance.
  
To run:
To run the program, ensure that cran.qry and cran.all.1400 are located in the same location as the python file (sm6412_HW4.py). From the command line, simply run the file with the file name, in my case it would be: python sm6412_HW4.py
